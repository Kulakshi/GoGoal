Updates :
	x,y cordinates are read and passed trough the devices to the other
	user activity gets that message and update the position of ovals
	two ovals are drawn on the campus
	objects are passing through both devices properly  
Pitfalls :
	users are not properly identified yet, only 2 ovals can be drawn with positions available.
	all messages are comming through a single stream (arraylist)
Todo : 
	find correct user and update correct oval
